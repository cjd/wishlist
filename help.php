<h2 class="categoryHeader">Viewing Other People's Lists</h2>

<a name="viewOther"></a><h3>How do I view someone's list?</h3>
<p>To see someone's wishlist, you first need to be granted permission. Once the list owner has given you access, their name will appear on your homepage. Simply click on their name to view their list.</p>
<p>If you don't see the person's list you're looking for, you can request access. Go to <b>Update Your Account >> Manage List Access</b> and use the search function to find the person by their username or email. This will send a request for them to approve.</p>

<a name="accessRequests"></a><h3>How do access requests work?</h3>
<p>When you request access to someone's list, the owner of that list will be notified the next time they log in. They will be presented with a dialog where they can approve or deny your request. They can choose to grant you read-only access, or full access (which includes the ability to see their contact information).</p>
<p>Once they have made a decision, you will be notified of the outcome the next time you log in. If your request is approved, you will see their name on your homepage and you will be able to view their list.</p>

<a name="checkOff"></a><h3>How do I mark an item as purchased?</h3>
<p>When you are viewing someone's list, you can mark items that you have purchased to prevent duplicate gifts. The way you do this depends on the quantity the person has requested:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Single Item:</b> If the person wants only one of an item, a checkbox will be displayed next to it. Click the checkbox to mark it as purchased.</li>
    <li><b>Multiple Items:</b> If the person wants more than one of an item, a dropdown menu will be displayed. Select the quantity you have purchased from the menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>After making your selections, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the <b>Save Changes</b> button. This will update the list for everyone else who can view it, so they can see what has already been purchased.</p>

<a name="removePurchase"></a><h3>How do I undo a purchase I marked?</h3>
<p>If you have mistakenly marked an item as purchased, you can easily undo it. At the bottom of each wishlist, you will find a link to the <b>Purchase Log</b>. This log shows all the items you have marked as purchased on that list.</p>
<p>Next to each item in the purchase log, there is a <font color=red>[Remove Purchase]</font> link. Click this link to remove your purchase, and the item will become available again for others to purchase.</p>

<a name="addComment"></a><h3>How do I add comments?</h3>
<p>Each wishlist has a <b>Comments</b> section at the bottom. This is a private space for people viewing the list to communicate and coordinate with each other. <b>The owner of the list cannot see these comments</b>, so it's a great place to ask questions or make suggestions about gifts.</p>
<p>To add a comment, click the <b>Add New Comment</b> button, type your message, and submit. You can also choose to send your comment as an email to other viewers of the list.</p>
